# Wiring requests

Lane B never edits scenes. When you need a node added, renamed, moved, or
wired, append one line here and keep working. Lane A clears the list on its
next scene pass and checks the box.

Format: `- [ ] (who asked) what is needed, which scene, why`

## Open

## Done

- [x] (lane B) Removed `Parent.routine_rows` override from `Main.tscn`; B5's
  15-row bathroom/dining route in `Parent.gd` is authoritative (`--verify-a51`).
- [x] (lane B) Attached `res://scripts/Player.gd` to `Player` in `Main.tscn`.
  The existing `Capsule`, collision shape, and tagged floor colliders satisfy B1.
- [x] (lane B) Attached `Door.gd` to BedroomDoor, Pantry, and Fridge with
  configured kinds, physical `DoorVisual` pivots, and snack-providing goal
  doors. Added the shared scripted `Snack` node and visual.
- [x] (lane B) Replaced Parent's AgentStub with `Parent.gd`, added
  `VisionCone`, retained its NavigationAgent3D, and set the routine rows to the
  A0.2 couch, kitchen, and kid-door coordinates. Default sibling paths resolve.
- [x] (lane B) Replaced Pet's AgentStub with `Pet.gd`; retained `Body` and
  `NavigationAgent3D`, and verified its default sibling paths resolve.
- [x] (lane B) Removed legacy `CollisionShape3D` children from all three
  `DoorVisual` nodes; `Door.gd` now owns the runtime doorway blockers.
